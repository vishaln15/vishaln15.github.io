Welcome &#128516;! I am Vishal Nagarajan, an MS Computer Science grad at [University of California San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/graduate/degree-programs/ms-program) joined in Fall 2022. I did my Bachelor's &#127891; in Computer Science and Engineering at [Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering](https://www.ssn.edu.in/), Chennai, India &#127979; from 2018 to 2022. I was also a Teaching and Research Assistant at the [Solarillion Foundation](https://solarillionfoundation.org/) where I had researched on current Machine Learning, and Deep Learning technologies. My interests broadly include Data Science, Embedded Machine Learning, and Signal Processing. You can check out my coursework in the [Education](https://vishaln15.github.io/education/) tab. My research papers have been [published](https://vishaln15.github.io/publications/) at conferences in India and USA. My [projects](https://vishaln15.github.io/projects/) include a wide array of domains such as Web Development, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I am intrigued by the advancement of technical sophistication, and am willing to learn and contribute to the AI community!

When feeling bored, I play Valorant, and I listen to [Weeknd's music](https://music.apple.com/in/playlist/my-weeknd-essentials/pl.u-NpXmzkGs4jBb6Gz?ls). I am a bit late into book reading, however, I love Percy Jackson and the Olympians, and Heroes of Olympus. On another note, I love Marvel and DC equally, and am a fan of horror genre. Feel free to [hit me up](https://vishaln15.github.io/contact/) &#128512;!
