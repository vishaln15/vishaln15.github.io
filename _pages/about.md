Welcome &#128516;! I am Vishal Nagarajan, a senior year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate &#127891; at [Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering](https://www.ssn.edu.in/), Chennai, India &#127979;. I am also currently a Research and Teaching Assistant at the [Solarillion Foundation](https://solarillionfoundation.org/) where I do research in current AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning technologies. My interests include Signal Processing and Embedded Machine Learning. I intend to pursue a Master's in Computer Science in 2022. You can check my coursework in the [Education](https://vishaln15.github.io/education/) tab. My research papers have been [published](https://vishaln15.github.io/publications/) at conferences in India and USA. My [projects](https://vishaln15.github.io/projects/) include a wide array of domains such as Web Development, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I am intrigued by the advancement of technical sophistication, and am willing to learn and contribute to the AI community!

When feeling bored, I play Valorant, Clash of Clans (you should definitely check out my base [here](https://link.clashofclans.com/en?action=OpenPlayerProfile&tag=90U2JCPUQ) &#128540;), and I listen to [Weeknd's music](https://music.apple.com/in/playlist/my-weeknd-essentials/pl.u-NpXmzkGs4jBb6Gz?ls). I am a bit late into book reading, however, I love Percy Jackson and the Olympians, and Heroes of Olympus, and am currently on Dune series binge. Feel free to [hit me up](https://vishaln15.github.io/contact/) &#128512;!
