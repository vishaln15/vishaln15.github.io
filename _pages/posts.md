<h2>Journey to the centre of "Masters in US" </h2>

---

<p>Here's a post on <b>my</b> entirely overwhelming, bitter-sweet ride with respect to Master's in US application. Grab some &#127871; and read it should you have time!</p>

<p>Somewhere around the later half of my sophomore year, I interacted with a lot of people and I understood that education in other countries is less doctrinal and more liberating. I wanted freedom in the education that I take. So a Master's seemed like my best bet. </p>

<h3>Brief nitty gritty about applications</h3>

Most US MS applications have some standard ingredients required.

<ol>
    <li>GRE Score (sometimes atleast)</li>
    <li>TOEFL | IELTS | (Maybe Duolingo too) Scores</li>
    <li>Transcripts | GPA </li>
    <li><b>Letter(s) of Recommendation</b></li>
    <li><b>STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</b></li>
</ol>

<p>Having a good GRE score is a nice add-on, but it's not the only factor at play in one's application. A good TOEFL speaking score will make you <b>eligible</b> for TA in most schools. A good GPA ensures that your application has water. A lower GPA does not mean the opposite, however. </p>

<p>The two more important aspects of the application are LORs and SOPs. Great LORs and killer SOPs can almost guarantee admits. Both of these take time, and a lot of effort to shape them well. But it's worth it!</p>

<h3>Back to Journey</h3>

<p>Admission season means wherever you are, you're likely to check the application portal of each school through your laptop, or phone (if you're out). It was a nail-biting couple of months for me. I had my admits and rejects. Having a great companion through the process helped me stay level-headed and hope for the best. One fine afternoon when I was having lunch (it was April 8th, 2022. Yep, I'll never forget), and I receive an email that I have an update on the portal. I open the browser to check my portal and to my astonishment, I received an admit from UC San Diego MSCS. It was a fun blast for 5 whole minutes, after which my naturally overthinking brain spiraled into <i>What's next?</i> Little did I know that getting an admit is the beginning, and that there was an even more frightening process following up!</p>

<p>Enter <b>VISA appointments</b>, where we have no idea why officers might reject applicants. VISA dropbox people have it little easier because there's usually no interview. Finding an appointment date using the <i>CGI Federal portal</i> involved a lot of <i>Ctrl+Shift+R</i>. Eventually I found an appointment, and I got my VISA approved as well.</p>

<p>A couple of months pass by and I go for shopping and start packing slowly. Before I could really comprehend what's going on, I landed in Los Angeles and drove to UCSD. </p>
